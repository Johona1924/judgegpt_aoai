# Key-based authentication

## Local deployment

Need to set AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY_OVERRIDE= \< Your azure open AI API key \>  and USE_AZURE_SEARCH_KEY=True, and set AZURE_SEARCH_KEY=\< your azure search key \>

The variable AZURE_OPENAI_DISABLE_KEYS does not seem to have any effect in local demployment.
